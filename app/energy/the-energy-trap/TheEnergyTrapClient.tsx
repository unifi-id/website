              Most organisations treat the 2022 energy crisis as a spike that will pass. The evidence assembled in this paper points the other way: gas still sets the price of British electricity most of the time, the grid needs major investment that will be recovered through bills, balancing costs are rising, and demand is climbing.
            </Body>
            <Body className="text-lg text-unifi-gray-dark">
              The consequence is simple but expensive. The price of a wasted unit of energy is not fixed; it escalates. Over the life of lighting, heating, and equipment, avoidable waste compounds into a much larger cost than most estates teams and finance leaders initially model.
            </Body>
            <Body className="text-lg text-unifi-gray-dark">
              Deferring an efficiency upgrade is therefore not a passive wait-and-see choice. It is an active choice to keep paying a rising tariff on waste that could already have been removed.
