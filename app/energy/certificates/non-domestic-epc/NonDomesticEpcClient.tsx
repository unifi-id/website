                A Non-Domestic EPC provides a standardised rating of a building&apos;s energy
                performance. It can meet an immediate requirement for construction, sale or letting,

            <Body className="mb-8">
              In England and Wales, a Non-Domestic EPC is generally required when a qualifying
              non-domestic building is constructed, sold or rented out. The requirement can apply to a
              whole building or to a part designed or altered for separate occupation.

            <Body>
              Where a valid certificate already exists, it can normally be reused for the transaction.
              A Non-Domestic EPC remains valid for its full period unless a newer certificate is
              lodged, in which case the newer certificate becomes the valid one. A lease renewal or
              extension with an existing tenant does not trigger a new certificate. An EPC should be
              commissioned before marketing begins, and the government has said it intends to require
              a certificate to be in place from the point a building is first marketed. Requirements
              should always be checked against the circumstances of the individual property.

              Under the Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards, a landlord in England and Wales cannot
              let, or continue to let, a non-domestic property with an EPC rating below E unless a
              valid exemption has been registered. The rating on a Non-Domestic EPC therefore affects
              what an owner can do with a building, not only what has to be disclosed.
            </Body>
            <Body>
              Government has proposed raising the minimum standard over the coming years and has not
              yet confirmed a timetable. Planning improvements now, with the recommendation report as
              the starting point, avoids a transaction or a lease event forcing the work at short
              notice.

              A Non-Domestic EPC is currently valid for 10 years, or until it is replaced by a newer

              letting during that period. Changes to validity periods were consulted on during 2025;
              at the time of writing the 10-year period continues to apply.

            <Body>
              A voluntary reassessment may still be useful after material improvements, particularly
              where an owner wants the registered rating to reflect the upgraded building before a sale
              or letting.

              The last of these is changing. In its March 2026 response, the government confirmed that
              it intends to remove the EPC exemption for heritage buildings, so that they will need a
              valid certificate when marketed, let or sold. An exemption from minimum standards will
              remain where the improvements would unacceptably alter the building&apos;s special
              character. Timing is still to be confirmed.
            </Body>
            <Body>
              The position depends on the building&apos;s construction, use, services and
              circumstances, and an exemption that applied in the past will not necessarily apply
              today. Unifi.id can help identify which buildings appear likely to need an assessment and
              coordinate the next step. Any legal reliance on an exemption should be confirmed for the
