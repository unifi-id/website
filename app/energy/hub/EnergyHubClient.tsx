                              <Body>State schools are under relentless pressure to stretch every pound - with estate budgets often fixed or ringfenced, upgrades are pushed back year after year.</Body>
                              <Body>But delaying improvements doesn't just defer costs. It locks schools into higher energy bills, growing maintenance burdens, and environments that fall short of supporting pupils and staff. And waiting for government grants that may never arrive only prolongs the problem, leaving schools paying more each month for outdated, inefficient systems.</Body>
                              <Body>Lighting is often one of the largest energy drains in a school, with outdated fluorescent or halogen systems consuming far more power than modern LEDs. The result: wasted funds, poorer light quality, and missed opportunities to meet sustainability goals.</Body>
                              <Body>Yet replacing legacy lighting doesn't need to be prohibitively expensive. By structuring costs differently, schools can modernise without pulling money away from teaching and learning.</Body>

                              <Body>Emergency service facilities - fire stations, police stations, ambulance stations - require reliable, high-quality lighting for operational readiness around the clock. Energy costs are significant, but upgrading infrastructure competes with frontline equipment and staffing needs.</Body>
                              <Body>These mission-critical facilities cannot tolerate lighting failures or quality compromises. LED technology delivers superior reliability and instant-on performance while dramatically reducing energy consumption and maintenance requirements.</Body>
